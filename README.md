- 👋 Hi, I’m @DisastrousFate
- 👀 I’m interested in system automations, VEX V5 Robotics and simulations.
- 🌱 I'm currently experimenting with the following projects:
  - Automated email system via google maps api (New Places API, AI, various python libs)
  - Arduino based quadcopter (multiwii expansion)
  - Raspberry Pi 4B (RPI-4B) OMV server running "Immich" (local media server integrating with custom cloud reverse proxy)
  - 3D Printing software "Klipper" with custom tweaks and modifications + Orcaslicer (Ender V3 KE)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that comes up to fruition ;)
- 📫 How to reach me: alex.halesworth@gmail.com
